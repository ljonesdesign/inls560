# Book List

What is this?
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
```

>The main reason for this code is to manage code when importing modules. It prevents issues. We don't need to go into this today, but just know that is why it is used. You will see this a lot when looking at other developers' code.

## Project Goals
Manage a list of books in a `book.txt` file.

We will start out with just two fields.

```
Book title: 1984
Quantity: 3
```

We will create six files:

```python
book_add.py          # lets us add a book record
book_display.py      # displays book records
book_os_delete.py      
book_os_modify.py
book_search.py       # modifies quantity only
