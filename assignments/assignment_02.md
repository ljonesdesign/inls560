# Assigment 02

We began assignment to in class from [looking at this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fredmqsDRSivpXaNQKabISEIoeFbkfhuc-F-QrBV1tM/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g27d7880ce6e_0_83)

Your goal was to take this code;

```
cars = ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']

for car in cars:
    if car == 'bmw':
        print(car.upper())
    else:
        print(car.title())
    
```

And change it to this:

```
items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4']

for item in items:
    print(item.upper())

```
Except you need to change thing and things to something meaningful to you.

This may seem like a simple excercise. And it is if you just copy and paste and change.

But try to come up with five things and loop through by memory. You might find that 
to a bit more challenging.
